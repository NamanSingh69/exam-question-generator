[1 x 10] (a) Write two advantages of distributed systems over centralized ones. (b) Concurrency transparency is a desirable goal for distributed systems.

Explain all the 14 steps used in the Remote Procedure Call from Client-to-Server. What is transparency design issue in distributed system? Explain location transparency, and migration transparency. Suppose that the time to do a null RPC (ie., 0 data bytes) is 1.0 msec, with an additional 1.5 msec for every 1K of data. How long does it take to read 32K from the file server in a single 32K RPC? How about as 32 1K RPCs? Consider the behaviour of two machines in a distributed system. Both have clocks that are supposed to tick 1000 times per millisecond.

      "(b) (a) (b) (a) (b) the other ticks only 990 times per millisecond. If UTC updates come in once a minute, what is the maximum clock skew that will occur? A distributed system may have multiple, independent critical regions. Imagine that process 0 wants to enter critical region A and process 1 wants to enter critical region B. Can Ricart and Agrawal's algorithm (distributed algorithm for mutual exclusion) lead to deadlocks? Justify your answer. Explain the situation of \"false deadlock\" that occurs in the centralized deadlock detection algorithm. Explain how you can overcome this situation using \"Chandy- Misra-Haas algorithm\" for distributed deadlock detection. Differentiate between distributed deadlock detection and distributed deadlock prevention. A process with transaction timestamp 50 needs a resource held by a process with transaction timestamp 100. Compare the results when: i. Wait-die deadlock prevention algorithm is used. ii. Wound-wait deadlock prevention algorithm is used. In a certain workstation based system, the workstations have local disks that hold the system binaries. When a new binary is released it is sent to each workstation. Some workstations may be down when this happens. Design an algorithm that allows the updating to be done automatically, even though workstations are occasionally down.
